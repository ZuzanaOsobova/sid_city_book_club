## SidCity Book Club website
This is the codebase for the sid city book club website, I have decided to create after we've been reading strong for few years and the Goodreads list would not suffice. It's a simple website which shows you which books and when we have read and also additional information about the books. The basic MVP only shows these, everything else has to be setup in the database.

## Tech Stack
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Javascript 

**Backend:** PHP 8.3

**Database:** MariaDB (but it's simple and can be changed into other databases)
