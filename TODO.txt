1) Login and user
    Login page
    User page - settings (change password, create new book)
    Check all edit and delete/save for logged-in user
    database table for users
        possibly already add user/admin

2) Change database to include table of genres
    create two new tables (genres, genre-book M:N)
    edit.php change so it shows all the genres and is a possible select
        I will just add new genres in the database
        make it multi select
    page.php edit so it shows all the genres from correct table
